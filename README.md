- Instructions to use CLI: TBD
- URL to web app: N/A
- Most challenging part of the assignment: We ran into lots of errors when running our scripts to create our AWS resources
    and also accidentally deleted our lab 6s running the wrong delete-resources.sh script. Once we got past all of that and got
    our stack created, most of our difficulties came from debugging our registration and login functionalities. Thankfully someone
    on the discord gave us good debugging advice that helped us move forward. CLI TBD
- Features that are buggy or not implemented: CLI TBD
