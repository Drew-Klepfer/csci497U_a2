# Report
- Names: Drew Klepfer and Ben Zunker
- API link: https://ie2soeyvn5.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod
- Instructions to use CLI: N/A
- URL to web app: N/A
- Most challenging part of the assignment: We ran into lots of errors when running our scripts to create our AWS resources
    and also accidentally deleted our lab 6s running the wrong delete-resources.sh script. Once we got past all of that and got
    our stack created, most of our difficulties came from debugging our registration and login functionalities. Thankfully someone
    on the discord gave us good debugging advice that helped us move forward. By far the most challenging part of the assignment
    was trying to figure out how to create a CLI or web app. By the time we got this far after figuring out our user registration,
    login, and game logic we were too close to the deadline. We may use a slip day to try and figure out this part of the assignment.
- Features that are buggy or not implemented: We did not end up implementing a CLI or web app. Features that are buggy include
    performing moves- at the moment there is no check to see what character a player puts into a game board square.
